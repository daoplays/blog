                Introduction
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                In this post we are going to create a launch Dapp for a pair of custom tokens on the Solana blockchain, which incorporates
                charitable giving as a core part of the payment process.
                <br />
                <br />
                We will be using a 'pay what you want' model similar to something like{" "}
                <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://humblebundle.com">
                    {" "}
                    Humble Bundle
                </a>
                , in which participants will be able to pay whatever they want for a block of 1000 tokens above some small minimum price. In
                our implementation we have set that minimum to 0.0001 SOL which is about 0.35 US cents at time of writing. They will also be
                able to choose how much of that payment we donate to their choice of charity, and how much stays with us, the app's
                developers.
                <br />
                <br />
                Additionally, if a user pays more than the current average they will not only get double the tokens, but they will also
                receive a special supporters token, which might be used as a governance token for your project, or to unlock special
                features in your applications.
                <br />

                Creating Solana Tokens
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                To create our tokens on the Solana blockchain we will be making use of the Strata Protocol{" "}
                <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://app.strataprotocol.com/launchpad/manual/new">
                    launchpad
                </a>
                . Strata makes creating new tokens extremely straight forward, with the whole process taking only a matter of minutes. They
                also charge zero additional fees to use their platform, which means creating your token only costs about 0.01 SOL, or 30 US
                cents at time of writing.
                <br />
                <br />
                You can specify which network you want to launch your token on from the drop down menu on the top right. For this post we
                will be creating two tokens on the devnet network. The first will be the primary token for our application, which we will
                imaginatively call the 'Dao Plays Test Token', with symbol DPTT. We want this to <i>feel</i> like the sort of token you
                would get in an old fashioned fairground or arcade, so we will set decimals to zero. Our launch Dapp will be selling blocks
                of 1000 or 2000 tokens so we set a supply of 100 million for an optimistic cap of about fifty to one hundred thousand
                participants.
                <br />
                <br />
                The launchpad then provides two final options: i) whether to keep the mint authority, which will allow you to mint more of
                this sort of token in the future, and ii) whether to keep the freeze authority, which will allow you to freeze token
                accounts associated with this token. Neither of our tokens will keep their freeze authority, and for this first token type
                we will also not keep the mint authority, so our supply of 100 million tokens will be all that is ever created. When you
                click the Create Token button you will be prompted to authorize a couple of transactions related to setting up the accounts
                that will hold your tokens and the token meta data, and then you are done!
                <br />
                <br />
                We then repeat this process for our second token, which we call the Dao Plays Supporter Test Token. In this case we keep
                decimals as zero, but as we will initially only need a much smaller quantity we set the supply to be one hundred thousand.
                Given we anticipate that this token will be used over many applications going forward, rather than just one as with the
                primary token type, we also retain mint authority so that we can produce more if that becomes necessary.
                <br />
                <br />

                Now that we have our tokens it is time to set up our charity wallets. The Giving Block allow you to donate either to
                individual organizations, or what they refer to as index funds, which makes it easy to contribute to a collection of
                similarly themed organizations, where the donation is split evenly between all the members of the index.
                <br />
                <br />
                In our example we will be including one index fund (the Ukraine Emergency Response Fund), and six individual charities,
                which we list below. These cover a range of different sectors such as the environment, accessibility to water, education,
                human rights, health & medicine, and effective giving. You can see a short description of each of these charities in their
                own words by hovering over the logos below, and can find out more by following the links to their TGB page. We also include
                a description of each in our front end application at the end of the post.

                wallet addresses, so that every time you go back to the page and repeat this process you will be presented with a new
                address. This means that if privacy is a concern you can donate from different personal wallets, to different TGB wallets,
                in order to obfuscate your donations from third parties.
                <br />
                <br />
                The only drawback with this process currently is that there is no way to cryptographically verify that one of these dynamic
                addresses really is related to The Giving Block, or therefore, to verify which cause it is for. This is a shortcoming that
                they are currently working to resolve, but until then when developing a trustless DApp, we have to rely on a
                non-cryptographic solution to publicly verify the accounts. In particular, after getting your wallets it is necessary for
                you to donate a small amount to each one, publicly display the transactions to these (for example by tweeting the
                transaction ids), and then TGB will verify via their twitter account that these donations were for genuine accounts, and
                which causes they are linked to.
                <br /> <br />
                While this allows potential users of your program to be confident that the wallets they are sending their crypto to are
                genuine, it unfortunately doesn't solve the reverse problem. It would be great to have the option for a user of our token
                sale to simply provide us with the account of a charity they would like to support, rather than having to choose one from a
                list. However currently there is no way for us to verify on chain in an automated way that the account really is a TGB
                account, hence why we must provide a list of authenticated accounts. We will be sure to post an updated version of this
                guide when the cryptographic solutions are available.

                Now that we have both our tokens and our charity wallets we can start putting together the program that is going to actually

                Creating The Program's Data Account
            </h4>
            <br />
            <p>
                The most straight forward way to handle a token launch is to have our program be responsible for sending out tokens to
                participants. Right now, however, the tokens are sitting in our own accounts, and the program doesn't have any authority to
                take the tokens from there, and send them on as needed. We therefore need to give the program control over the tokens, and
                to do that we first create (or more accurately, find) what is referred to as a 'Program derived address' (PDA).
                <br />
                <br />
                There are many in depth discussions of exactly what PDAs are already available online (for example{" "}
                <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/pdas.html">
                    here

                or{" "}
                <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://www.brianfriel.xyz/understanding-program-derived-addresses/">
                    here
                </a>
                ) so we won't spend much time discussing the technical details of how they differ from a standard wallet address. For our
                purposes it is enough to say that a PDA is nothing more than the public key for an account that is owned by a program rather
                than by a person. Having a PDA will allow the program to have it's own token accounts, and critically will allow it to sign
                transactions that involve sending tokens from those accounts. Only the program that owns the PDA will be able to sign such
                transactions, and so in this regard the PDA provides the same functionality to the program as a keypair provides to a human.
                <br />

                function to find a PDA for your program which can be used on or off chain to easily obtain the right public key, without
                having to actually store it anywhere. This function takes as arguments an array of bytes that will be used as a seed (in our
                case just the string "token_account", where the lower case "b" converts that to a byte array), and the program's own public
                key.

            for this function, you can see that all it is doing is calling the <Code p="0">create_program_address</Code> function using both
            the provided seed, and a separate bump seed which starts at a value of 255 and decreases by one until the function finds a valid
            PDA. Once it has been found it is recommended to directly call <Code p="0">create_program_address</Code> on chain and simply
            pass the correct bump_seed, rather than reusing <Code p="0">find_program_address</Code> as the former can be significantly less
            costly.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now that we know where the program's account is going to live we need to actually create it, and for this we make use of

            <HighLightCode codeBlock={create_account} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            The <Code p="0">from_pubkey</Code> refers to the wallet address that will fund the creation of the account, and the{" "}
            <Code p="0">to_pubkey</Code> is simply the address where we want to create our new account which will be the PDA. The third
            pubkey that is passed as the last argument, <Code p="0">owner</Code>, is the address of our program. In english then, this will
            create a new account for which our program will be the owner, at the location of our newly found PDA, and we will fund it's
            creation with our own wallet.
            <br />
            <br />
            The other two arguments, lamports and space are related. In order to have an account and to store data in that account you need
            to pay what is referred to as{" "}
            <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rent">
                rent
            </a>
            . There are two supported methods of paying rent, but we will only be interested in the <i>rent-exempt</i> method, where we
            deposit enough lamports into the account to ensure it survives indefinitely without being deleted.
            <br />
            <br />
            As you might expect, the more data you want to store the more rent you need to pay. If you have the solana CLI installed you can
            use this to check the current rent-exempt cost for any amount of data. For example, if you ask for the rent required for 0
            bytes, you will be shown the cost to have a basic account that stores no additional data:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={rent_0} language={"bash"} />
            <br />
            In order to achieve this rent exempt state we will therefore have to know what we want to store, and what the rent-exemption
            cost will be to store it. We define the following struct in our program which is going to save a summary of the totals donated
            to each charity, the total paid, and the number of accounts that have participated in the launch.
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={ico_state} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            As this is quite a simple struct we could quite easily work out the size by hand, and then check the rent-exempt cost. The borsh
            library however provides a straight forward way to do this for us using the{" "}

            function provided by Solana then takes this size and returns the current balance in lamports required for us to keep the account

            The seeds that are passed are the same as those that we used to find our derived program address initially, along with the bump
            seed returned by that program. In this way the program is able to sign the transaction that will create it's own account.

                Creating The Token Accounts
            </h4>
            <br />
            The next piece of functionality we need to add is the ability to create the token accounts for our program. On the Solana
            blockchain each user can only store tokens of a particular type in a token account that corresponds to that type of token. As
            discussed in the Solana{" "}
            <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account">
                docs
            </a>{" "}
            it is perfectly possible for a user to have multiple token accounts for the same token, which can make it difficult for a
            program to know which account tokens should be sent to. The Associated Token Program was thus introduced as a way to
            deterministically derive a token account address from the combination of a user's wallet address and the token's mint address.
            As both the user and the program will arrive at the same token account address when using this method it also makes it easy for
            the program to create the account when required and overall reduces friction during token launches.
            <br />
            <br />
            These accounts are called Associated Token Accounts, and in order to create one we first need to get the address using the{" "}

            to actually create the account:

            <br />
            With these functions in mind we then have everything we need to implement the creation of our token accounts. We show below out
            complete function which we will simply call twice when initialising the token launch, once for the main token account, and once
            for the supporters token account. Note in this case we need only call <Code p="0">invoke</Code> rather than{" "}
            <Code p="0">invoke_signed</Code> because it is the funding wallet that will be signing the transaction, rather than our program.
            <br />
            <br />

                Transferring The Tokens
            </h4>
            <br />
            The final task we must perform in this function is to transfer our tokens to the programs newly created token accounts. To do
            this we will be making use of the spl_token function{" "}
            <Code p="0">
                <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://docs.rs/spl-token/latest/spl_token/instruction/fn.transfer.html">

            </Code>
            :
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={transfer_function} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            The arguments here are relatively self explanatory, the <Code p="0">authority_pubkey</Code> in this case will be our wallet,
            however when the program is transferring tokens to other users that will be the PDA. In our use cases we will be leaving the
            signers vector empty. Our complete function to handle transferring the tokens is shown below, and it's structure should by now
            by quite familiar! We simply create the instruction, and then call <Code p="0">invoke_signed</Code> to handle the cross program
            invocation and actually enact the transaction. Note that in this case we could have used <Code p="0">invoke</Code>, as our PDA
            doesn't need to sign this transaction, however when the program is sending out tokens then we do need to use{" "}
            <Code p="0">invoke_signed</Code> and it is simpler to just use it generically for both cases.

                Joining The Token Launch
            </h3>
            <br />
            <p>
                The second of our main functions will allow users to participate in the token launch, and will be responsible for handling
                the SOL payments and sending out the different token types to the participants. The overall flow of the code is as follows:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Load and check all of the accounts passed to the function</li>
                <li>Check that the minimum payment has been exceeded</li>
                <li>Create the users main token account if required</li>
                <li>Check that the user doesn't already have tokens, and that there are enough tokens left to send</li>
                <li>Check if the user paid over the average</li>
                <li>Transfer SOL to the charity and developers</li>
                <li>Transfer tokens to the user</li>
                <li>Update the statistics stored in the program's account</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            This function expects to be passed thirteen accounts, and as before we will skip over the loading and checking of all of these
            in this post. The first real check we make is to ensure that the minimum amount to be paid has been exceeded. We do this before
            creating any accounts or going further into the function.
            <br />
            <br />
            When calling the join_ico function from off chain we pass a JoinMeta struct, which has the following fields:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={join_meta} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            Here <Code p="0">amount_charity</Code> and <Code p="0">amount_dao</Code> are the amounts in lamports to be paid to the chosen
            charity, and to the developers respectively. The <Code p="0">Charity</Code> type of the final member of this struct refers to an
            enum we have defined in <Code p="0">state.rs</Code>:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={charity_enum} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            In order to check that the minimum amount has been exceeded, we therefore need only sum amount_charity and amount_dao and
            compare that to the minimum, which in this example we have set to 0.0001 SOL, or about 0.35 US cents at time of writing:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={join_0} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            We next check if the joiners associated token account already exists by using{" "}
            <Code p="0">
                <a
                    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
                    href="https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/account_info/struct.AccountInfo.html#method.try_borrow_lamports"
                >
                    try_borrow_lamports
                </a>
            </Code>
            , which will return a positive value if it has been previously initialised and there are lamports present in it. If it doesn't
            exist we create it using our <Code p="0">create_token_account</Code> function:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={join_1} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            The next step is to check whether the user's token account already has Dao Plays Test Tokens in it. In an ideal world we would
            be able to limit a person to participating only once in the token launch, so that we could maximise the number of unique users
            taking part. Unfortunately this is impossible, as a single user can just create multiple accounts in order to participate as
            many times as they would like. We at least want to make our intentions clear though, and so stop someone from participating if
            they already have tokens in their account so that they at least need to spend transaction costs to either move them elsewhere,
            or to create a new token account with a different wallet. In order to do this we need to get the account's{" "}
            <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://docs.rs/spl-token/latest/spl_token/state/struct.Account.html">
                data
            </a>{" "}
            from the token account, which we do with the provided{" "}
            <Code p="0">
                <a
                    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
                    href="https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/program_pack/trait.Pack.html#method.unpack_unchecked"
                >
                    unpack_unchecked
                </a>
            </Code>{" "}
            function:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={join_2} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            Next we want to check whether the participant has paid more than the current average, in which case they are awarded supporter
            status, and so will receive double the number of DPTTs, and an additional supporters token. The current average price is stored
            in the program's data account, so we first have to retrieve that using the{" "}
            <Code p="0">
                <a
                    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
                    href="https://docs.rs/borsh/latest/borsh/de/trait.BorshDeserialize.html#method.try_from_slice"
                >
                    try_from_slice
                </a>
            </Code>{" "}
            function from the{" "}
            <Code p="0">
                <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="https://docs.rs/crate/borsh/latest">

                </a>
            </Code>{" "}
            crate. As a last check before proceeding we simply make sure there are enough DPTTs remaining. We don't need to do this for the
            supporters tokens as we have made sure there is a sufficient supply even if every participant is a supporter.
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={join_3} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            In order to transfer SOL from one account to another on chain we once again make use of the <Code p="0">invoke</Code> function,
            this time executing the{" "}
            <Code p="0">
                <a
                    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
                    href="https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/latest/solana_sdk/system_instruction/fn.transfer.html"
                >
                    transfer
                </a>
            </Code>{" "}
            instruction, first to send the charity's amount, and then the developer's:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={join_4} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            The next section introduces nothing new. We first transfer the DPTTs to the participant, and then check to see whether they have
            supporters status in order to create the associated token account for the supporter token (if required) and then send that as
            well:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={join_5} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            The last step in this function is to update all the launch statistics with the new participants payment and donation. We once
            again use the <Code p="0">borsh</Code> library to send the current state to the program's data account using the{" "}
            <Code p="0">
                <a
                    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}

                    serialize
                </a>

            function:
            <br />

                Ending the Token Launch
            </h3>
            <br />
            In order to end the token launch we are simply going to transfer any remaining tokens that are in the programs two token
            accounts back into our own accounts, and then close those token accounts in order to retrieve the lamports being used to
            maintain their rent exempt status. We will leave the program and data account up and running so that we can continue to access
            the donation statistics, though in principle this could also be transferred elsewhere if you so wished. The only new function we
            will make use of here is the spl_token instruction{" "}
            <Code p="0">
                <a
                    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
                    href="https://docs.rs/spl-token/latest/spl_token/instruction/fn.close_account.html"
                >
                    close_account
                </a>
            </Code>
            :
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={close_account} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            This can only be called on a token account that has no tokens remaining, and will take care of transferring the lamports to the{" "}
            <Code p="0">destination_pubkey</Code> account. The reason that we can't simply do this ourselves with a transfer instruction is
            that neither we nor the program actually own the token account, the token program does, and so the token program must be the one
            that sends us the lamports.
            <br />
            <br />
            We define our <Code p="0">close_program_token_account</Code> function below, which takes the our program account and it's token
            account, our wallet and the destination token account and the token program itself:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={close_account_one} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            We first perform a couple of sanity checks. Firstly the destination token account should already exist in our use case as we are
            simply returning the tokens to their original home, and secondly the program's tokens account should also still be initialised
            and have it's lamports. If the latter isn't true we must have already closed the account and so we can simply return out of this
            function as there is nothing left to do.
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={close_account_two} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            As in our <Code p="0">join_token_launch</Code> function we make use of the <Code p="0">unpack_unchecked</Code> spl_token
            function to grab the token account's data so that we can retrieve the remaining token balance. If there are any tokens left we
            then make use of our <Code p="0">transfer_token</Code> function to send them to the <Code p="0">destination_token_account</Code>
            :
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={close_account_three} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            As the last step we now make use of the spl_token <Code p="0">close_account</Code> function, and call{" "}
            <Code p="0">invoke_signed</Code> to allow our program to sign the transaction:
            <br />
            <br />
            <HighLightCode codeBlock={close_account_four} language={"rust"} />
            <br />
            Our <Code p="0">end_token_launch</Code> function then simply has to call this function for both the main token account, and the
            supporters token account after parsing and checking the account details as usual.
