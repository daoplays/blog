          <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Install the Solana CLI and create a file system wallet</li>
          <li>
            Install the phantom wallet extension and create a browser wallet
          </li>
          <li>Import the file system wallet into Phantom</li>
          <li>Import a Phantom wallet as a file system wallet</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          These last two are where most of the problems lie, and are a result of
          the many ways that you can derive a public key from a mnemonic seed
          phrase. Phantom and the Solana CLI employ slightly different
          standards, and use language that can be easily conflated, which can
          lead to confusion when people first start getting involved with
          Solana. Hopefully by the end of this post that confusion will be
          cleared up, and you'll be ready to start interacting with your first
          dApps! As a small check that everything is set up, there is a simple
          'AirDrop' app at the bottom of the post which you can use to pay
          yourself fake SOL that can be used on the development network.

          Setting Up A File System Wallet

        <br />

        <p>
          When working within a single ecosystem, getting set up with a wallet
          is (typically) quite straight forward. The official{" "}
          <a
            style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}

            docs
          </a>{" "}
          will take you through installing the CLI, so we won't repeat that
          here. We will only add we recommend just going with the stable version
          of the tool, so for example on MacOS and Linux that would mean
          running:
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <HighLightCode codeBlock={install_cli} language={"bash"} />

        <p>
          <br />
          And then following the last steps as described in their guide. With
          the tools installed you can then straight forwardly create a file
          system wallet with one of the following commands:
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <HighLightCode codeBlock={solana_keygen_system} language={"bash"} />

        <p>
          <br />
          When you enter this you will then be presented with the following
          prompt, which will be one possible source of conflict between the CLI
          and Phantom:
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <HighLightCode codeBlock={bip39} language={"bash"} />

        <p>
          <br />
          The official docs don't have much too say about the BIP39 passphrase,
          so this will be the first topic we dive into with a bit more detail.
          The 39th <i>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal</i> (BIP), which you can read{" "}
          <a
            style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
            href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki"
          >
            here
          </a>{" "}
          defined the process both for producing a mnemonic seed phrase, and
          converting it into a binary seed from which wallets could be generated
          (more on that last point later). The advantage of having some standard
          protocol by which to generate these phrases and produce wallets means
          that in principle, if you want to change your wallet provider (say,
          from a file system wallet to a Phantom wallet) you should be able to
          do this simply by knowing your mnemonic seed phrase.
          <br />
          <br />
          The BIP39 passphrase is an additional layer of security, as it means
          that even if your seed phrase is revealed it will still be very
          difficult for anyone to actually determine what your private key is as
          long as you have a good passphrase. As the passphrase is defined by
          the user, this can be easier to remember than the random string of
          words, and likely doesn't need to be written down anywhere. The
          problem with the passphrase is that not all wallets support it (at
          least at time of writing). This means that if you use a passphrase
          now, you won't be able to import your file system wallet into
          something like Phantom using just your seed phrase. If you try you
          will just find that the public key Phantom derives is totally
          different from the one you were using in the file system case (though
          there can be more reasons for this which we will come to later).
          <br />
          <br />
          Make sure also to note in this message that the file system wallet is
          just stored in plain text. This is one of the main disadvantages of
          such a wallet, and seems a bit of a strange choice. If anyone gains
          control of the hardware on which the file is stored, they will have
          access to your private key, so in general file system wallets are only
          recommended for learning about Solana, and not for keeping accounts
          with large amounts of value in them.

          That is it for setting up the Phantom wallet. If you want to you can
          skip ahead to the bottom of the page to try it out and Airdrop
          yourself some devnet SOL. In the next two sections we will try and
          reconcile these two accounts, which especially in the final case
          (importing a Phantom wallet into the file system) is a bit of a rabbit
          hole.

        <p>
          This will be quick. If you click the hamburger icon on the top left of
          the Phantom app you'll see there is the option to add or connect a
          wallet. From there click "import private key".
          <br />
          <br />
          Potentially because of the uncertainty around using seed phrases
          between different wallet providers, Phantom asks for your private key
          directly rather than the seed phrase. You can find this in the file
          you generated previously using the Solana CLI, as an example one we
          created looks like the following:
          <br />

        <br />

          This will not be quick. The CLI provides a means of recovering a
          keypair from a seed phrase using the command:
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <HighLightCode

  `}
          language={"bash"}
        />
        <br />
        <p>
          Enter your "secret recovery phrase" that you got when setting up the
          Phantom wallet. The CLI will then ask you to enter the associated
          passphrase. As Phantom doesn't support this, just hit enter. You will
          then be shown a public key and asked if you want to continue.
          Comparing that public key to the one displayed on the phantom app
          though, they are not the same! The reason they aren't the same is down
          to something called 'Hierarchical Derivation' of keypairs. Here is
          what the official docs have to say on the subject:
        </p>

        <br />

        <Box style={{ paddingLeft: "5%", paddingRight: "10%" }}>
          The solana-cli supports BIP32 and BIP44 hierarchical derivation of
          private keys from your seed phrase and passphrase by adding either the{" "}
          <span style={{ backgroundColor: "lightgrey" }}>?key=</span> query
          string or the{" "}
          <span style={{ backgroundColor: "lightgrey" }}>?full-path=</span>{" "}
          query string. By default,{" "}
          <span style={{ backgroundColor: "lightgrey" }}>prompt:</span> will
          derive solana's base derivation path{" "}
          <span style={{ backgroundColor: "lightgrey" }}>m/44'/501'</span>. To
          derive a child key, supply the{" "}
          <span
            style={{ backgroundColor: "lightgrey" }}
          >{`?key=<ACCOUNT>/<CHANGE>`}</span>{" "}
          query string.
          <br />
          To use a derivation path other than solana's standard BIP44, you can
          supply{" "}
          <span
            style={{ backgroundColor: "lightgrey" }}
          >{`?full-path=m/<PURPOSE>/<COIN_TYPE>/<ACCOUNT>/<CHANGE>`}</span>
          . Because Solana uses Ed25519 keypairs, as per SLIP-0010 all
          derivation-path indexes will be promoted to hardened indexes -- eg.{" "}
          <span style={{ backgroundColor: "lightgrey" }}>?key=0'/0'</span>,{" "}
          <span style={{ backgroundColor: "lightgrey" }}>
            ?full-path=m/44'/2017'/0'/1'
          </span>{" "}

          I think even a seasoned crypto veteran might find this hard to parse

          <i>COIN_TYPE</i> is always 501, which is the index of Solana in the

          <i>ACCOUNT</i> is an integer from 0, and is incremented each time you
          want to derive a new account
          <br />
          <i>CHANGE</i> should be 0 for any account that you want to be visible
          outside the wallet, and therefore be able to receive funds
          <br />
          <br />
          By default, the Solana CLI provides the derivation path m/44'/501'
          which actually generates the master keypair for your seed phrase. The
          two BIPs suggest that in general you shouldn't actually use this one,
          because if someone gains control of your master key, they will gain
          access to all your derived accounts, whereas losing a derived keypair
          means losing only that account. This is where the reference to the
          indices being <i>hardened</i> comes in. If you generate non-hardened
          derived keys, then knowledge of any descended keypair will allow you
          to determine the master key. If the path is hardened then even with
          knowledge of any number of derived keypairs it is impractical on any
          reasonable time frame to determine that those derived keypairs came
          from the same master, and therefore impractical to determine what that
          master was.
          <br />
          <br />
          While the Solana CLI will generate the root keypair by default,
          wallets like Phantom will give you the first keypair along the
          derivation path, i.e they start with m/44'/501'/0'/1', and increment
          from there every time you add a new account from the same seed phrase.

          Use Your Phantom Wallet In A Simple DApp
        </h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          At this stage you should hopefully have your Phantom wallet set up,
          and at least one of your phantom wallets imported as a file system
          wallet, so as a last step let's actually make use of them! Firstly
          make sure that your wallet is connected to the devnet rather than the
          mainnet. You can do this by going to the settings in the app, clicking
          "Change Network" and selecting devnet.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once you've done that, just click the big purple button below to
          connect to your Phantom wallet.
        </p>
        <br />

        <AirDrop />

        <br />
        <p>
          Once it has connected you should see the account pubkey to the right
          of the button, and the current balance below. Clicking the Airdrop
          button will pay yourself 1 SOL on the devnet, which you can then spend
          on testing your own dApps, or interacting with other devnet programs.
          If you want to swap between different Phantom accounts (via the
          hamburger icon in the app), just hit disconnect and then reconnect
          once you've switched.
          <br />
          <br />
          As one last thing, if you have imported one of your phantom accounts
          into a file system wallet, you can confirm that they are all pointing
          to the same place. First, as with Phantom you will need to point the
          Solana CLI to the devnet, which can be done by entering the following
          on the command line:
        </p>
        <br />
        <HighLightCode
          codeBlock={`
  solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
  `}
          language={"bash"}
        />

        <br />
        <p>
          You can then check the balance on your account with the following,
          replacing the json file with whatever you named your imported file
          system wallet:
        </p>
        <br />
        <HighLightCode
          codeBlock={`
  solana balance phantom_0.json
  `}
          language={"bash"}
        />
        <br />

        <p>
          That should give the same balance, and confirm that everything has
          worked as expected.
          <br />
          <br />
          On that note we will bring this post to a close. Hopefully you have
          learnt something about the way your keypairs are generated, and if
          nothing else have paid yourself some fake SOL to spend on future
          projects. If you did find this useful feel free to follow us on{" "}
